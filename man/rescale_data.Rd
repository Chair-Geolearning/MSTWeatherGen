\item{names}{Names of the variables included in the simulation.}

\item{dates}{Vector of dates corresponding to the time dimension in the sim array.}
}
\value{
Simulated data with variables other than "Precipitation" rescaled back to their original scale.
}
\description{
Function to rescale simulated weather data for variables other than "Precipitation" to their original scale.
